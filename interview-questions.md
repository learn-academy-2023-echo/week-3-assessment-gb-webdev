# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX? 

Your answer: JSX is written in .js, html elemnts can be used, but sometimes the syntax has to be different, eg. class="" is now className="" some html elemnts are nested in fragments too <> </>. 

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension to .js, it's classed as a markup language that produces react elements and has the full power of js. Those elements are then rendered to the DOM. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal? 

Your answer: yarn is a package manager, it alters APP files? 

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager AND can manage your projects. It holds thousands of basic components and allows you to access and run them in your apps easily. It allows you to share and for other people to open your work instantly too, with said components. it alters .json files.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: It's the same as a function but in JSX/React

Researched answer: components are reusable bits of code like a js function, but they return html code. There are class and function components .

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State stores code information and props can use it? 

Researched answer: State is a built in Object within React, it contains data about components, it renders it and updates it when the components state is altered. Props are similar to html attribnutes, they can not be changed once passed into a component, they pass data from one component to another to get dynamic outputs. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: The rendered version of the code? 

Researched answer: The DOM(document object model) is a programming interface for web documents. It allows the programming languages interact with the page through the nodes and objects. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: A div tag is a divider element in html/react, it can nest more elements or be used to seperate parts of a page.
I don't know what a span tag is sorry.

Researched answer: div is block level element and span is an inline element. So span will stay on the same line, where as div will end an old line and start a new one. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: OOP is a programming model that works on the concept of classes and objects, rather than functions and logic. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted programming language, it's extremly popular and easy to read/write. There are multiple ways to problem solve in Ruby

3. Implicit return: recieving a value from a function without using the return keyword. Mainly used for if you have 1 line of code, it is "implied" and then not needed.

4. Ruby blocks: anonymous functions that can also be passed into methods .

5. Ruby hashes: a data structure that stores items by associated keys, its kind of like an array, it has built in methods that can be used.
